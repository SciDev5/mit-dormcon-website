First years, welcome to MIT, and welcome to DormCon REX! We hope you have a
blast while getting to learn more about all of our awesome dorms.

## Events

All REX events can be viewed on the [REX Events page](/rex/events), though
physical REX booklets with the events are also available during REX.

The [REX Events page](/rex/events) is a project of the DormCon Tech Chair.
Please email all bugs and feedback to dormcon-tech-chair@mit.edu. You can view
the documentation for the REX API [here](/rex/api).

**<REXEventDates />** Event details will be available around August, so stay
tuned!

## About REX

Residence Exploration, or **REX**, is a multi-day experience for first year
students to explore MIT dorms and find their future home on campus. For those of
you who haven't already decided where you're going to live, REX is the perfect
time to explore MIT's dorms and pick the place where you fit in best with the
culture and residents. For the rest of you, REX is a great opportunity to find
out about the different parts of campus that you otherwise might not experience.
Most of all, REX is a time to enjoy yourself, meet as many people as possible,
first years and upperclassmen, and get a feel for everything MIT has to offer.

If you have any questions about REX, email dormcon-rex-chairs@mit.edu, and if
you're experiencing an issue with the events website or you have any technical
feedback, email dormcon-tech-chair@mit.edu.

## About FYRE

**FYRE**, the First-Year Residence Exchange, is a system that allows you to
request to swap from your temp dorm into another dorm you'd prefer living in.
Different people are drawn to different communities, and we want everyone to be
placed where they'll be happiest. **FYRE takes place at the end of REX**, and
FYRE will not move you without your consentâ€”if you're interested in a different
residence hall, we strongly encourage you to participate. You can find more
information on
[the MIT Guide to Residences](https://mitguidetoresidences.mit.edu/housing-information/first-year-housing).

## Who is DormCon?

MIT's Dormitory Council, or **DormCon**, is an elected group that represents
dorm residents just like you and puts on awesome things like REX. If that's
something you think you might be interested in, come hang out with us at our REX
event! You can also check out our [About](/about) page or come to
[one of our meetings](/about/meetings).
