## About REX

Residence Exploration, or **REX**, is a four day experience for first year students (and this year, sophomores too!) to explore MIT dorms to help their future home on campus.
If this includes you, welcome to MIT! We hope REX helps you find your home here, and if you have any q]stions, email dormcon-rexvp@mit.edu.

If you're experiencing an issue with the events website or you have any technical feedback, email dormcon-tech-chair@mit.edu.

## Who is DormCon?

MIT's Dormitory Council, or **DormCon**, is an elected group that represents dorm residents and puts on awesome things like REX.
If that's something you think you might be interested in after REX, check out our [About](/about) page or come to [one of our meetings](/about/meetings)!
