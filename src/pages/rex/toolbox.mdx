## Bookmarks tool

You can use this page to import and export your bookmarks. The bookmarks are in a
common format, so you can move them between devices and browsers. 
For example, you could save events to your bookmarks on your laptop and move them to your phone,
or vice versa with this tool.

import BrowserOnly from '@docusaurus/BrowserOnly';
import {BookmarksTool} from '../../../components/t-rex/Bookmarks.js';

<BrowserOnly><BookmarksTool /></BrowserOnly>

## API Data

If you want to make use of the raw API data yourself, you're more than welcome!
The events are available at https://camk.co/t-rex/api.json, and will update automatically
as new events are posted.

If you have any questions or feedback on the API, feel free to contact dormcon-tech-chair@mit.edu,
though unfortunately, I don't have the bandwidth to offer tech support for any derivative projects.
