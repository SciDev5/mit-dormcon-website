# How to use the REX Events Page

[↩️ Back to REX Events](/rex/events)

## Finding events

Using the widget at the top of the page, you can filter for events

-   only from a certain 🏠 **Dorm**
-   ⏰ **Now** and/or ⏰ **Upcoming**
-   with a certain 🏷️ **tag**
-   only in your ⭐️ **bookmarks**
-   on a certain 🔍 **keyword** using the search box

By default, the REX Events page shows only events happening now or in the future. Press ❌ **Clear** to clear all filters.

## Exploring events

### Tags

Underneath the title of the event, you'll find the tags attached to the event by the dorm REX chairs.
These can help you narrow down events with **food** or events that are a **party**.

### Start and End Times

The REX Events page will also tell you how long until an event starts or how long until it ends.
**If you'd like to see an exact date and time instead, click the ⏱️ emoji.**
You can click the ⏰ emoji to go back to a countdown.

### Saving Events

You can use the **▼ dropdown** to ⭐ **Bookmark** an event or 📅 **Add to your Calendar**.

⭐️ **Bookmarks** are stored locally on your device and will be removed if you erase your browsing data.
The 📅 **Add to Calendar** button will take you to Google Calendar, where you can edit the pre-filled
event details before adding the event.

## Something else?
