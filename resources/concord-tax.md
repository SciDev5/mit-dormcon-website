As you may know, student organizations, including clubs and dorms, have not been
able to use the MIT sales tax exemption at Concord Market so far. The following
information is about how student organizations can claim this sales tax
exemption; please share it with your dorm's financial signatories and with any
clubs you are a part of who may be interested. Please note that you still cannot
claim a sales tax exemption for your group at Concord Market through the
standard RFP process:

In order to claim a sales tax exemption at Concord Market, your group needs to
have a CVC (controlled value card) holder, and your CVC card holder must make
the purchase. For dorms, multiple members of exec can be CVC card holders, but
each person must apply for a card separately, and each CVC card holder is
responsible for uploading documentation of each purchase to Engage, similarly to
how you fill out an RFP. For clubs, only one member of your club can be a CVC
card holder, and that card holder is responsible for uploading documentation of
each purchase to Engage. If a financial signatory in a student organization
wants to get a CVC card, they can fill out the following form:
