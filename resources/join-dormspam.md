## What is dormspam?

- Dormspam is a bunch of email lists which you can send to (and receive from!),
  in order to get information about clubs, events on campus, sales, and more!
- The email lists are organized by dorm/living group. This website exists to
  centralize joining dormspam into one place.
- Dormspam, and bulk email lists in general, have a
  [long history](https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/an_explanation/) at MIT,
  and is a really important part of MIT culture! You can join for now if you
  want to figure out what dormspam is all about, and so you don't miss out on
  anything, and if you decide later that you want to filter it or stop receiving
  it altogether, that's okay too! You can come back to this website if you want
  to unsubscribe!

## What kinds of emails get sent to dormspam?

- Anything! Most emails are advertisements such as performances/events or club
  meetings (often with free food or boba!), but other common emails include
  sales (with cheap furniture/clothes/AC units), job/UROP opportunities, and
  silly surveys.
- The great thing about dormspam is that anyone can send anything they want, and
  the lists are generally unmoderated. That means that sometimes, controversial
  topics that you disagree with may get discussed. But of course, you can filter
  your email however you want to, and you don't need to read emails that you
  don't want to engage with!

## How do I send emails to dormspam?

- [dormspam.mit.edu](https://how-to-dormspam.mit.edu/) is a great resource which
  tells you all the norms for sending dormspam emails correctly, so people can
  filter properly!

## What dormspam list should I be on?

- Go to [join-dormspam.mit.edu](https://join-dormspam.mit.edu/), which will
  automatically identitify which dorm you live in, and tellsyou how to join that
  list.
- If you don't live in a dorm, it will redirect you to `random-hall-dormspam`,
  which is run by Random Hall, but is open to all current undergraduate and
  graduate students. `random-hall-dormspam` does not get any traffic other than
  dormspam.
