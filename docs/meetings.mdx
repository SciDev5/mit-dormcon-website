## About Dormcon Meetings

DormCon Meetings are open to [all dorm residents](/about/voting-members). If you are not a resident in one of MIT's eleven dormitories but would like to attend a DormCon meeting, please email us (dormcon-exec@mit.edu).

The Zoom link for our meeting can be found [here](https://mit.zoom.us/j/93298082254).

The agenda for each meeting is sent to dormcon-announce@mit.edu two days before the meeting. Feel free to add yourself, or email dormcon-secretary@mit.edu for help.
