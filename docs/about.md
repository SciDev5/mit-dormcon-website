# About DormCon

## Mission and Constitution

The Dormitory Council (DormCon) is MIT's student government body representing
undergraduate dormitory residents. Voting members from each dormitory (usually
the president) comprise DormCon and meet every two weeks to discuss and propose
policies and programs that affect and benefit the entire dormitory system;
relevant student and administrative guests are invited regularly to discuss
pertinent issues.

DormCon exists to preserve and develop dormitory culture both individually and
as a system. DormCon is the unified voice of opinions and concerns of dormitory
residences; moreover, it works and strives to create a community where all
undergraduate dormitory residents are comfortable and feel welcome. DormCon
serves three primary roles: liason/advocate for student views to other groups
and administrators, resource for event funding, and communication with students
about dorm issues and changes. More information can be found in
[this document](/pdf/dormcon_roles.pdf).

DormCon's [constitution](/pdf/constitution.pdf) governs the organization.
