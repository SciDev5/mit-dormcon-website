## Funding Guidelines

DormCon is committed to supporting events in the dorm community through funding
and advisory roles. As of fall semester 2017,
[the following funding guidelines](/pdf/DormconFundingF17.pdf) were adopted; if
you plan to apply for event funding, you must read these updated guidelines.
Some important facts are noted below:

-   Funding applications must be submitted at least 48 hours before the meeting
    at which the application is to be discussed.

-   If possible, event applications should be submitted by the second DormCon
    meeting of the term. Up to 50% of event funds may be distributed at this
    time, with the remainder available for applications on a rolling basis.

-   The online application must be filled out for any events and a
    representative from the group will be contacted to attend a DormCon meeting
    as needed. Rolling events must be submitted three weeks prior to the event
    in order to allow sufficient time for DormCon review and potential approval.

-   No event will be funded beyond 50% of its total event budget, up to a
    maximum of $1,750.

-   Events must be classified into one of four categories; in general,
    preference will be given to events which are advertised to the entire dorm
    community and subsequently to those which are sponsored by multiple dorms.
    Events sponsored by (non-dorm) student groups are not eligible for funding.
