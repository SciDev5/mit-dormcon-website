# Event Funding

## Funding Guidelines

DormCon is committed to supporting events in the dorm community through funding
and advisory roles.
[The following funding guidelines](/pdf/DormconFundingS24.pdf) were adopted as
of spring 2024; if you plan to apply for event funding, you must read these
updated guidelines. Some important facts are noted below:

- Funding applications must be submitted at least one week before the meeting at
  which the application is to be discussed.

- If possible, event applications should be submitted by the second DormCon
  meeting of the term. Up to 50% of event funds may be distributed at this time,
  with the remainder available for applications on a rolling basis.

- The online application must be filled out for any events and a representative
  from the group will be contacted to attend a DormCon meeting as needed.
  Rolling events must be submitted three weeks prior to the event in order to
  allow sufficient time for DormCon review and potential approval.

- No event will be funded beyond 50% of its total event budget, up to a maximum
  of $500 for parties and $2000 for all other events. Party organizers can email
  dormcon-treasurer@mit.edu with an explanation to request that their event be
  considered for the full $2000.

- In order to actually get the funding transferred into your account, you must
  fill out a post-event report.

- Events must be classified into one of four categories; in general, preference
  will be given to events which are advertised to the entire dorm community and
  subsequently to those which are sponsored by multiple dorms. Events sponsored
  by (non-dorm) student groups are not eligible for funding.
