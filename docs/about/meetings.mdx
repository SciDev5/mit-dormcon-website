## About DormCon Meetings

DormCon Meetings are open to [all dorm residents](/about/voting-members). If you
are not a resident in one of MIT's eleven dormitories but would like to attend a
DormCon meeting, please email us (dormcon-exec@mit.edu).

The agenda for each meeting is sent to dormcon-announce@mit.edu two days before
the meeting. Feel free to
[add yourself](https://groups.mit.edu/webmoira/list/dormcon-announce), or email
dormcon-secretary@mit.edu for help.
